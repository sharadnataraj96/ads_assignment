FAQ How often should I apply the Resurfacing Compound? We recommend applying it once in the evening or twice a day: morning and night. I'm having some irritation after using the Resurfacing Compound for the first few days. What should I do? If irritation occurs, reduce your usage to evening only until it subsides. 
And always be sure to protect your skin with an SPF, like the Multimodal Defender Balm SPF30 or the Multimodal Sheer Mineral Sunscreen, when you go outside while using the Resurfacing Compound. Is it normal for the product to pill on my skin? U Beauty Resurfacing Compound is a dynamic, multifunctioning formula engineered
differently from other products. Pilling may occur if too much is applied and isn’t fully
massaged into the skin or if applied after an oil-based product. The Resurfacing
Compound should be the first layer on your dry skin after cleansing. How long will the product last me? The 15 ml size should last two weeks; the 30 ml should last four weeks; and the 50 ml size should last about six weeks when used as directed. Can I use a discount code on a subscription?

This hero product contains ingredients that deliver results. Vitamin C helps boost the skin’s own collagen and diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Stabilized vitamin E works to defend the skin against damage-causing free radicals, hyaluronic acid helps provide lasting hydration, AHAs help decongest pores and provide gentle exfoliation, and antioxidants work to neutralize damage. Unlike other skin resurfacing products, the Resurfacing Compound utilizes our proprietary SIREN Capsule Technology™ to deliver crucial anti-aging ingredients to areas that need it most—without overloading the skin or causing visible damage or irritation. This is one of the best facial resurfacing products to fight visible skin discoloration concerns, including dark spots, dullness, and uneven tone, and it visibly improves overall skin texture. Whether you have sensitive, combination, or oily or dry skin, this compound enhances your daily regimen, leaving you with healthy, rejuvenated-looking skin. Pair the Resurfacing Compound with The BARRIER Bioactive Treatment, an overnight skin renewal cream , and our Multimodal Defender, a next-generation SPF balm , to visibly restore, enhance, and protect the skin.
